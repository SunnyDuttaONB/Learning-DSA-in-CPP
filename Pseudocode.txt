How to Solve a Problem?
1) Understand
2) Input 
3) Solution
4) Code

Flowchart:- Diagram of a Solution
Eg) Print the Sum of two Numbers;
Start -> Input a & b -> Sum = a + b -> Print Sum -> Exit

1) Area of a Square:-
Start -> Input a -> area a*a -> Print area -> Exit

2) Min of 2 Numbers:-
Start -> Input a & b -> if (a<b) print a -> else print b -> Exit

3) Is Number Odd or Even:-
Start -> Input n -> if (n%2==0) print Even -> else print Odd -> Exit

4) Sum of Numbers from 1 to n:-
Start -> Input n -> count = 1 , sum = 0 -> while(count<=n){{sum = sum + count }count = count + 1} -> Print sum -> Exit

5) Is Number Prime or not:-
Start -> Input n -> i = 2 -> while(i<=(n-1)){{{if(n % i == 0)}Print Non-Prime}Exit} else{i+=1} -> Print Prime ->Exit

6) Calculate Simple Interest from Principal(P),Rate(R) & Time(T):-
Start -> Input p,r,t,simpI-> simpI = (p*r*t)/100 -> print simpI -> Exit

7) Calculate Max of two Numbers:-
Start -> Input a & b -> if(a > b) print a -> else print b -> Exit

8) Calculate Factorial of a Number:-
Start -> Input n -> fact = 1 , i = 1 -> while(i<=n){{fact = fact * i} i = i + 1} -> End while -> Print fact -> Exit

9) Given a Person's age, find if they should get a driving licence or not.
Start -> Input age -> if(n >= 18) print "Can get Driving Licence" -> else print "Cannot get Driving Licence" -> Exit
